# Onboarding

## Style Guide
For Javascript, use the AirBnB style guide: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript  
For Python, use the PEP8 style guide: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/  

## Ethos
### Learn
“Learn” means always keep pushing to understand what you don’t already know, because as Isaac Asimov wrote, “past glories are poor feeding.” The moment you feel like you’ve won, or that you’ve got it all figured out, you are dead.

### Build
“Build” is a forcing function. Words like “write,” “create,” or “teach” work here as well. If you force yourself to transform what you’ve learned into something that is your own, then you’ve really learned. You’ve also made something that can serve others.

### Share
“Share” means connection. Sharing openly and transparently creates a feedback loop which accelerates learning and improves whatever it is you are building. It also creates a community of like-minded people with similar values and curiosities. 

### Repeat 
“Repeat” emphasizes that this is a game which is never complete. This isn’t about accomplishments, goals, or endpoints. It is a romance with the process itself.

For the circle to work, fuel is required: **curiosity**.
