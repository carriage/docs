# Documentation
Carriage is an open-source, decentralized platform for EV charging that helps get electric vehicle charging infrastructure installed where drivers need it, enforceably reserved when they want to use them, and repaired when they have issues. Our goal is to accelerate the adoption of electric and autonomous vehicle by building tools that support the infrastructure the industry needs.

# Overview
## Components
Carriage consists of a protocol layer of smart contracts (Carriage DNA) that are built on top of the Ethereum blockchain that function at each stage of the lifecycle of a charging station: initial project financing, ongoing use (payments and reservations), and maintenance & repairs.

On top of these protocols is an application front-end layer for drivers and charging station owners. The mobile application for drivers is the Carriage RNA, and the web application for station owners is the Carriage UI.
